### Constructed in Python v3.9 using Turtle
![turtler game](turtler_images.gif "turtler Game")<br>
_a reimagined frogger game_
<br/> 
<br/>

The turtle starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by many speeding cars. The player must guide the turtle between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill, which results in a loss of a life.<br><br>
See how many levels you can complete! The player starts with 3 lives and each successful road crossing is followed by an increase traffic speed. This game is not as easy as it sounds.
